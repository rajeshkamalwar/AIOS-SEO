# CAP-POL-01 — Applicable policy resolution

Canonical responsibility: [CAP-POL-01](../../docs/14-CAPABILITY-TAXONOMY.md) (exact row ID); inherited [contract](../../docs/15-CAPABILITY-CONTRACT.md) and [archetype applicability](../../docs/18-BUSINESS-ARCHETYPE-MATRIX.md). Definition is deliberately not copied.

Full capability maturity: **DEFINED**, completion: **INCOMPLETE**. Local evidence scope: `foundation_only` / `TESTED`.

Versioned source/skill manifest validation and local approved-release integrity gates.

Implementation: [index.ts](../../packages/skills/index.ts), [manifest.json](../../spec/sources/manifest.json), [quality-gates.json](../../spec/quality-gates.json)

Tests: [jobs.test.ts](../../tests/jobs.test.ts), [contracts.test.ts](../../tests/contracts.test.ts)

Evidence/reports: [40-POST-M5-INTEGRATION-REALITY-REVIEW.md](../../docs/40-POST-M5-INTEGRATION-REALITY-REVIEW.md), [41-NEXT-PHASE-READINESS-PLAN.md](../../docs/41-NEXT-PHASE-READINESS-PLAN.md), [N1-IMPLEMENTATION.md](../../docs/reports/N1-IMPLEMENTATION.md)

Remaining: No general platform/surface rule-applicability resolver; source files and draft source pins do not constitute released SEO knowledge.

Open gaps: [GAP-DOM-POL](../gaps/GAP-DOM-POL.md).

## Stage evidence

| Stage | Current evidence disposition |
| --- | --- |
| DEFINED | Canonical row and inherited contract linked above |
| IMPLEMENTED | Full canonical scope not established; partial code listed separately |
| TESTED | Full capability acceptance not established; fixture prerequisites are scope-limited |
| REAL_WORLD_VERIFIED | No authorized retained capability-level verification found |
| PRODUCTION_PROVEN | No production observation window/denominator and operations proof found |

## History

- 2026-09-18 baseline2b6d527: conservative inventory import; no maturity promotion from test counts or draft manifests.
